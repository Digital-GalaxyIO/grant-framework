### Project Details

Digital Galaxy is a collaborative platform that provides both creators and collectors with the best possible experience. We are a home base for those that seek to discover digital cultures.

Conception

After 3 years in the NFT world, we no longer wanted to eat what was served on the plate. After recognizing numerous areas of improvement in existing marketplaces, the idea of the Digital Galaxy was birthed. The beauty of DG is that we aren’t a billion-dollar entity chasing the hot new thing. Our team is made up of creators and collectors, who have experienced both joy and pain in their NFT adventures. We are here to expand on the positives and eliminate the negatives. This will allow our community to have an enjoyable journey when pursuing their passions and hobbies.

### Ecosystem Fit

> 3. What needs does your project meet for the community and what sets it apart from other similar projects? 
-We are driven by providing the best user experience for buying and selling digital assets, experience across different chains buying and selling NFTs we see a massive gap in Proton lacking.   
-We can have worked to created public profiles across other ecosystems as buyers, sellers, creators. This can drive new engagement from creators and buyers to Proton 
-$XPR is the sole currency on our marketplace currently. This is to push adoption of the network until we can become multichain and proton has grown
-Team has experience of 2 decades of digital asset knowledge from other industries. The use of parametric modelling, NFTS, Smart contracts and advancements in DLT technology 
will allow us to create a digital assets markeplace that innovates in many ways.
